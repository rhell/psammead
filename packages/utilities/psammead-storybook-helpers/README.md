## Contributing

When **adding** a new export to this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/dab14a2732cfa620e083b7da66a148b4189474a7/packages/utilities/psammead-storybook-helpers/index.test.jsx#L7-L13) also need to be updated. When **removing** an exisiting export from this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/dab14a2732cfa620e083b7da66a148b4189474a7/packages/utilities/psammead-storybook-helpers/index.test.jsx#L7-L13) need to be updated and the package version requires a major change (EG: 1.2.1 -> 2.0.0) as this would be considered a breaking change due to functionality being removed.
